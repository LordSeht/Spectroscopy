    "This Jupyter Notebook is meant to conduct the anaylsis as well as to present the results of the atomic spectroscopy lab. Generally all code provided is a guideline in order to get your analysis started. In case you want to use your own methods, feel free to change as much of the code as  you like. Each of the three tasks starts with the analysis of the data, followed by some calculations and ends with a discussion. The first task provides a lot of the code needed, whereas in the last part most of the coding is up to you. To get you started you can work through the [Introduction Jupyter Notebook on Canvas](https://canvas.education.lu.se/courses/13958/pages/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook?module_item_id=409993).\n",
